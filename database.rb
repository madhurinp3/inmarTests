require 'active_record'
require 'oci8'


@client=ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
    :adapter => 'oracle_enhanced',
    :host => '@localhost:1522:orcl',
    :database => 'test',
    :username => 'sys',
    :password=>'password'
)
sql = "SELECT * FROM users"

result = @client.exec_query(sql)

results.each do |row|
  puts row[0]
end
